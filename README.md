Educational Organisation Using ServiceNow
Project Overview

This project presents the design and implementation of an Educational Organisation Management System developed using the ServiceNow platform. The objective of this project is to automate and streamline academic and administrative processes within an educational institution. It demonstrates how ServiceNow can be effectively utilized to manage student records, course allocation, service requests, and workflow automation in a structured and efficient manner.

Project Description

The system is designed to simulate real-world educational operations by creating custom tables, forms, and workflows within ServiceNow. It includes student management, faculty coordination, course handling, and automated task assignment. Business rules, UI policies, and workflows are implemented to ensure smooth process execution and reduce manual intervention. The project highlights how ServiceNow’s platform capabilities can be adapted beyond IT services to support educational administration.

Technologies Used

This project is developed using the ServiceNow platform (Zurich release). It utilizes core ServiceNow features such as Service Catalog, Flow Designer, Business Rules, UI Policies, Task Boards, and custom table creation. The implementation focuses on configuration-based development rather than heavy coding, following ServiceNow best practices.

Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained practical experience in configuring the ServiceNow platform, designing automated workflows, managing service catalogs, and implementing real-time record management. It strengthened my understanding of digital workflow automation and enterprise platform solutions in an educational context.

Conclusion

The Educational Organisation Using ServiceNow project demonstrates the practical application of ServiceNow for institutional process automation. It reflects my foundational knowledge of the platform and my ability to design structured workflow solutions for real-world organizational scenarios.
